    "title": "AI-Powered Document Processing for Equity Compliance",
    "shortDescription": "Developed a generative AI solution to automate the extraction and processing of financial documents, enhancing equity compliance workflows.",
    "description": "Slice Global, an AI-powered equity compliance platform, partnered with ScaleUp Labs to automate the processing of thousands of financial documents. The solution incorporated OCR for scanned documents and advanced PDF processing to extract relevant information, regardless of document structure. Leveraging FastAPI and deploying on Google Cloud Run, the system utilized AWS Rekognition for image analysis and integrated multiple LLMs, including Anthropic Claude and ChatGPT, with a fallback mechanism to ensure reliability. An orchestration system was built to manage complex workflows, linking extracted data to the correct individuals by matching with other financial sources. This comprehensive backend and AI solution transformed a manual, weeks-long onboarding process into a streamlined operation completed within a day.",
