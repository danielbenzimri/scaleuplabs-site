    "title": "LLM Interaction and Prompt Usage Analytics Backend",
    "shortDescription": "Developed a backend system to analyze LLM interactions and prompt usage, providing insights into user behavior and model performance.",
    "description": "Opster collaborated with ScaleUp Labs to develop an advanced backend system aimed at analyzing interactions and prompt usage within large language models (LLMs). The solution focused on capturing and analyzing metadata from LLM interactions, including prompt structures, response times, and usage patterns. This enabled Opster to gain valuable insights into user behavior, optimize prompt engineering strategies, and enhance overall model performance. The system was designed with a strong emphasis on privacy, ensuring that sensitive user data remained protected while still providing actionable analytics.",
